# Title

Hospital Network Design

## Abstract

This report describes the network design of Health care management or Hospital. In this network topology the nodes (i.e., computers, switches, routers or other devices) are connected to a local area network (LAN) and network via links (twisted pair copper wire cable or optical fiber cable). We have used Cisco Packet Tracer for designing the network topology It’s a general design which can be implemented at any higher level to manage network system.


## Network Requirements

In Health care Network topology, we have desktop Computer, laptops, smart phone. There is a data flow between the devices within the system. We have divided our network into segments like for Hospital wards , clinical area etc. We have also used SSH for security. Our network requirements include network devices like routers, switches, server.

## Hospital segments

1	General ward

2	Private ward

3	Clinical Area

4	IT Department

5	Entrance Reception

6	Lobby, Parking , Cafeteria
 

## Features and Services

•	DHCP

•	DNS

•	Subnetting

•	HTTPS

•	SSH

•	SMTP

•	FTP

•	WIFI


## Network Topology

The diagram is properly commented. We have divided the diagram into 5 small segments as named in part 4. Hospital Segments representing different departments of hospital. We have mentioned the IP addresses on each and every interface of the hosts and routers, ranges of each segment are clearly commented

## Summary

This report describes how we have designed network topology of hospital (Health care Management System).With VLSM for Subnetting, segmented the diagram into 5 segments. This topology can also be implemented on higher level of hospitals.
